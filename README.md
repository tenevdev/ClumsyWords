ClumsyWords
===========

##Definitions dictionary for Windows powered by Definitions.net

###Description

Clumsy words is a light and responsive app that let's users search for a word and find different definitions of it. The app stores all recent search requests and let's the user decide on adding some of them to the "Favourites" section. There is no account needed to take advantage of the full capabilities of the app itself. However, this software won't establish connection with the Definitions API unless you have a developer account. In case you have just replace the strings "DEVELOPER_KEY" with your own key and, of course, read the LICENSE.txt;

###Aim of the app

We, the developers of this application, are trying to bring technology to schools and private classes and use it to improve education. Our goal is to establish more sharing possibilities between teachers and students. We hope that Clumsy Words is going to prove useful in English classes for non-native speakers. Moreover, it is a great way to keep all records of definitions organised, have them available everywhere, share them with anyone via email.

###Partners

All definitions are provided by the Definitions API, which is part of the STANDS4 Network. Anyone can apply for a developer account on their website.

###Note

This is a preview / beta version of the app. We are sorry if there are errors and bugs.
