ClumsyWords
===========

##Definitions dictionary for Windows powered by Definitions.net

###Description

**We are currently working on building the app using the new Universal App template for Windows applications.**

ClumsyWords is a light and responsive app that let's users search for a word and find different definitions of it. The app stores all recent search requests and let's the user decide on adding some of them to the "Favourites" section. There is no account needed to take advantage of the full capabilities of the app.

###Aim of the app

We, the developers of this application, are trying to bring technology to schools and private classes and use it to improve education. Our goal is to establish more sharing possibilities between teachers and students. We hope that Clumsy Words is going to prove useful in English classes for non-native speakers. Moreover, it is a great way to keep all records of definitions organised, have them available everywhere, share them with anyone via email.

###Partners

All definitions are provided by the Definitions API, which is part of the STANDS4 Network. Anyone can apply for a developer account on their website.

###Note

This is a preview / beta version of the app. We are sorry if there are errors and bugs.
