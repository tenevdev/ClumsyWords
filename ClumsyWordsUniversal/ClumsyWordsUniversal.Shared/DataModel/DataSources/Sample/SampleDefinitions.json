The song was released as the album's fifth single on September 25, 2007. It was written by Fergie, Bobby Troup and will.i.am, who also produced the track. It was partially recorded in Los Angeles and in the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus. The song's lyrics about being clumsy and in love flow alongside its computerized and bleeping beat taken from \"The Bubble Bunch\" by Jimmy Spicer, as well as a sample of \"The Girl Can't Help It\", originally performed by Little Richard.\nThe song received generally mixed to positive reviews. Critics praised the Little Richard sample and the goofy lyrics on feelings of love. Some critics deemed it to be the album's highlight and pop at its finest, while others considered it flat. \"Clumsy\" peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Fergie's fifth straight top five hit in the US. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and has sold over two million downloads in the country. Internationally, the song peaked in the top five in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The song's music video, directed by Marc Webb and Rich Lee, is stylized like a pop-up book and features Swedish model Alex Lundqvist as Fergie's love interest.",

A word may consist of a single morpheme, or several, whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word. A complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes, or more than one root in a compound. Words can be put together to build larger elements of language, such as phrases, clauses, and sentences.\nThe term word may refer to a spoken word or to a written word, or sometimes to the abstract concept behind either.

Fluids are a super set of the phases of matter and include liquids, gases, plasmas and, to some extent, plastic solids.\nAlthough the term \"fluid\" includes both the liquid and gas phases, in common usage, \"fluid\" is often used as a synonym for \"liquid\", with no implication that gas could also be present. For example, \"brake fluid\" is hydraulic oil and will not perform its required function if there is gas in it. This colloquial usage of the term is also common in medicine and in nutrition.\nLiquids form a free surface while gases do not. The distinction between solids and fluid is not entirely obvious. The distinction is made by evaluating the viscosity of the substance. Silly Putty can be considered to behave like a solid or a fluid, depending on the time period over which it is observed. It is best described as a viscoelastic fluid. There are many examples of substances proving difficult to classify. A particularly interesting one is pitch, as demonstrated in the pitch drop experiment currently running at the University of Queensland.",

Fluids are a super set of the phases of matter and include liquids, gases, plasmas and, to some extent, plastic solids.\nAlthough the term \"fluid\" includes both the liquid and gas phases, in common usage, \"fluid\" is often used as a synonym for \"liquid\", with no implication that gas could also be present. For example, \"brake fluid\" is hydraulic oil and will not perform its required function if there is gas in it. This colloquial usage of the term is also common in medicine and in nutrition.\nLiquids form a free surface while gases do not. The distinction between solids and fluid is not entirely obvious. The distinction is made by evaluating the viscosity of the substance. Silly Putty can be considered to behave like a solid or a fluid, depending on the time period over which it is observed. It is best described as a viscoelastic fluid. There are many examples of substances proving difficult to classify. A particularly interesting one is pitch, as demonstrated in the pitch drop experiment currently running at the University of Queensland.",
